      <h3 link="doc">
	Improving the documentation
      </h3>

      <p>
	The documentation to the Heimdal is quite good, but we can get better.
	If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to submit text/comments via
	<a href="https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/issues/">GitHub's Heimdal Issues page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 link="bugs">
	Reporting bugs
      </h3>

      <p>
	This one is simple, if you find something, don't assume its already
	fixed, send us a short mail about it. If you do, you might get a patch
	back it the problem is already found, or help you'll help us make
	Heimdal even better.
      </p>

      <p>
	You submit the bugs via
	<a href="https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/issues/>GitHub's Heimdal Issues page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 link="tess">
	Adding tests to the regression suite
      </h3>

      <p>
	When you have a bug, think (and ask us) if its possible to do
	automated checking if that what now is broken works. This way you'll
	make sure the bug is not reintroduced again when its fixed. It's
	boring to report broken functionallity over and over again, so if you
	help us with this you don't have to.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you think this sounds like
	<a href="#reporting_bugs">Reporting bugs</a> is because its
	the next step after fixing a bug.  Making sure we never see it
	again.
      </p>

      <p>
	You submit the new tests and questions via
	<a href="https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/issues/>GitHub's Heimdal Issues page</a>.
      </p>
