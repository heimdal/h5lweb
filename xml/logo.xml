      <h3>
	The logotype
      </h3>

      <p>
	<img src="/ref/keyhole-heimdal.png"/>
      </p>

      <p>
	The logotype is a representation of the Kerberos protocol, the
	two parties (client and server) on either side of the trusted
	third party (KDC) that binds them together.

	The three parts of the logotype are in the shape of key holes
	since Kerberos uses cryptographic keys to protect the
	exchange.

      <h3>
	Why?
      </h3>

      <p>
	We choose the logo because of it uniqueness and that is was
	easy to use as an application icon. It just not yet another
	round icon in your Applications folder.
